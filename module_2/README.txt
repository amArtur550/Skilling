The essence of the project is to track the impact of living conditions of students aged 15 to 22 on their academic performance in mathematics, in order to identify students at an early stage at risk.

And this can be done using a model that would predict the results of the state exam in mathematics for each student in the school. To determine the parameters of the future model, you need to conduct an exploratory analysis of the data and draw up a report on its results.
